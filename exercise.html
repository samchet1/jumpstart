        <h2>Exercise</h2>

        <p>Exercise greatly improves mental well-being and mood. It releases serotonin and endorphins which can lead to a reduction in anxiety and stress.
        Kids need lots of opportunities and encouragement to take part in physical activities. Seek out a variety of activities that your kids can learn 
        to enjoy.  Family-oriented activities like bike-riding, jogging, and even yard work are a great way for everyone to get and stay fit together.</p>

        
        <h3>Aerobic Activity</h3>
        <p>Aerobics are the most important part of a child's physical activity. Activities like brisk walking, running, swimming, biking or any other 
        vigorous activity. Your child would ideally do 60 minutes of one of these activities each day or a minimum of 3 days a week.  
            

        <h3>Muscle-Strengthening</h3>
        <p>Kids need to build and maintain muscle just like adults. Activities like climbing, running, rowing, and even old stand-bys like push-ups, 
        sit-ups, and pull-ups can get the job done. Muscle-strengthening helps kids feel strong and powerful. Muscle-strengthening should be included 
        in the 60 minutes of physical activity at least 3 days a week.</p>
        
        <h3>Bone-Strengthening</h3>
        <p>Impact exercises like jump rope, running, hopping, basketball, and gymnastics are great bone builders. These exercises help kids' bones less
        likely to break. These should be done at least 3 times a week as part of the daily 60 minutes.</p>
        
        <p>To help your child be physically active:
        <ul>
        <li>emphasize the importance of physical activity and its benefits </li>
        <li>be a positive role model. Parents who are physically active themselves have children that are also physically active </li>
        <li>encourage your child to take part in sports </li>
        <li>limit time spent watching television or playing computer games</li>
        <li>encourage your child to do activities they enjoy, which might not be organised or team sports</li>
        </ul>
