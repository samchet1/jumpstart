        <h2>Well-Being</h2>
        
        <h3>Rest & Relaxation</h3>
        <p>Taking some time out to relax is an important way of helping minds and bodies switch off from daily pressures. 
        To help your child to relax, you could:
            <ul>
            <li>help them to take the time to pause and take a break</li>
            <li>encourage them to take notice of the world around them</li>
            <li>inspire creativity and imagination through art, writing, and reading</li> 
            <li>encourage them to practice yoga or meditation for kids</li>
            </ul>
            
            
        <h3>Sleep</h3>

        <p>Getting enough sleep can enhance mood and promote feelings of energy and well-being. To encourage your child to sleep better:</p>
            <ul>
             <li>try to make your child more active throughout the day</li>
             <li>encourage your child to do the same things in the same order before bed can help</li>
             <li>make sure their electronic devices are switched off at least an hour before bed</li>
             <li>make sure monitors, screens and devices are switched off before bed, as light from devices can interfere with sleep</li>
             <li>eat dinner at least 2-3 hours before bedtime</li>
            </ul>
            
        <h3>Routine</h3>
        <p>A routine will help your child feel more in control and bring structure into their life. To encourage a routine for your child:</p>
            <ul>

            <li>create more structure and opportunities for positive interactions </li>
            <li>encourage down time but make sure it isnâ€™t happening too often</li>
            <li>encourage them to have a plan for eating, sleeping, socialising, exercising and relaxing </li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Self-Esteem</h3>
        <p>Poor self-esteem can be damaging on general mood, health and well-being. To encourage good self-esteem:</p>
            <ul>
            
            <li>encourage your child to focus on their strengths and positive thinking </li>
            <li>support them to recognise the skills that they have </li>
            <li>encourage them not to dwell on the things they might not be so good at</li>
            <li>set small, realistic goals when doing something new, and try and reach them</li>
