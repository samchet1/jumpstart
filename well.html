        <h2>Well-Being</h2>

        <h3>Sleep</33>

        <p>Getting enough sleep can enh​ance mood and promote feelings of energy and well-being. Lack of good sleep can cause irritability, stress, anxiety 
        and bad moods. 

        To encourage your child to sleep better:

             <li><try to make children more active throughout the day</li>
             <li>encourage a routine; doing the same things in the same order before bed can help</li>
             <li>make sure they're switched off from electronic devices at least an hour before bed</li>
             <li>make sure monitors, screens and devices are switched off before bed, as light from devices can interfere with sleep</li>
             <li>eat dinner at least 2-3 hours before bedtime</li>
        
        <h3>Routine</h3>
        <p>A routine will help your child feel more in control and bring structure into their life.

        To encourage a routine for your child:

            <li>create more structure and opportunities for positive interactions </li>
            <li>encourage down time but make sure it isn’t happening too often</li>
            <li>encourage them to have a plan for eating, sleeping, socialising, exercising and relaxing </li>
            

        <h3>Self-Esteem</h3>
        <p>Poor self-esteem can be damaging on general mood, health and well-being.</p>
            
            To encourage good self-esteem:
            
            <li>encourage your child to focus on their strengths and positive thinking </li>
            <li>support them to recognise the skills that they have </li>
            <li>encourage them not to dwell on the things they might not be so good at</li>
            <li>set small, realistic goals when doing something new, and try and reach them</li>
        
        <h3>Bone-Strengthening</h3>
        <p>Impact exercises like jump rope, running, hopping, basketball, and gymnastics are great bone builders. These exercises help kids' bones less
        likely to break. These should be done at least 3 times a week as part of the daily 60 minutes.</p>
