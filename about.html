        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>This site was created in honor of my daughter who followed the baby-led weaning method and started feeding herself finger food at the 
        age of 6 months. She ate the same food that was prepared for adults, cut into chunks to facilitate eating on her own. She tasted a wide
        a variety of foods and textures from a young age, now at 10, she enjoys eating whole foods, like vegetables, poultry, fish, seafood, grains, 
        legumes, and fruits.
        
        She has always been active and currently plays golf, soccer, and badmiton. She also practices yoga and Transcendental Meditation.

        Wherever your child is on his or her health journey, small changes are always best with the goal of building life-long habits.
