        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>
        This site was inspired by my daughter who following the baby-led weaning method, fed herself the same food as adults from the 
        age of 6 months. She was exposed to a wide variety of foods and textures from a young age. Now, at 10, she enjoys eating whole foods, like vegetables, 
        poultry, fish, seafood, grains, legumes, and fruits.
        
        She has always been active and her current favorite sports are golf, soccer, and badmiton. She also practices yoga and meditates daily.

        Wherever your child is on his or her health journey, small changes are always best with the goal of building life-long habits.
